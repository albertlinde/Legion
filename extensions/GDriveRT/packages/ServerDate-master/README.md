# Introduction

ServerDate is used in web pages to make the server's clock available to the
client's browser via Javascript.

You can use it when you want to display the current time but don't trust the
browser's clock to be accurate, or to synchronize events for different users of
your web site by synching them all to the server's clock.

Usage is simple.  Add one `<SCRIPT>` element to your web page and then you can
use the `ServerDate` object in Javascript just like you use the built-in `Date`
object, except that it reflects the server's time instead of the client's.

# Requirements

ServerDate has been tested in the following browsers:

* Chrome 23.0.1271.64
* Firefox 16.0.2
* Safari 6.0.1 (7536.26.14)
* Internet Explorer 11.0.9600.18015

# Installation

Include the following `<SCRIPT>` element in your web page:

```html
<SCRIPT src="ServerDate.js"></SCRIPT>
```

## Usage

You may then use `ServerDate` as you would use the `Date` object or one of its
instances, e.g.:

```javascript
> ServerDate()
"Mon Aug 13 2012 20:26:34 GMT-0300 (ART)"

> ServerDate.now()
1344900478753

> ServerDate.getMilliseconds()
22
```

There is also a new method to get the precision of ServerDate's estimate of the
server's clock (in milliseconds):

```javascript
> ServerDate.toLocaleString() + " ± " + ServerDate.getPrecision() + " ms"
"Tue Aug 14 01:01:49 2012 ± 108 ms"
```

You can see the difference between the server's clock and the browsers clock,
in milliseconds:

```javascript
> ServerDate - new Date()
39
```

There is no constructor because it doesn't make sense to create more than one
instance of `ServerDate`.

Methods from `Date` to change the time, such as `setMinutes`, are not defined:

```javascript
> ServerDate.setMinutes
undefined
```

`ServerDate` is synchronized with the server's clock when it is first loaded and
then re-synchronizes itself from time to time to keep the two clocks from
drifting apart.
